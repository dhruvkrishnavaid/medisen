          One of our main aspects is to spread awareness about <b> mental health</b>,<br></br> a crucial but often
          overlooked aspect of healthcare.<br></br> <b>Mental health </b>refers to a person's emotional, psychological,
          and social well-being.<br></br> Among students, <b>mental health</b> issues such as increased stress levels,
          anxiety, depression, social isolation, and substance abuse are prevalent.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          To address these challenges, we prioritize <b>mental health awareness</b>
          <br></br> by offering free counseling sessions and access to mental health professionals.<br></br> By
          educating individuals, reducing stigma, and providing support services,<br></br> we strive to create a
          supportive environment where all students can thrive academically, emotionally, and socially.
